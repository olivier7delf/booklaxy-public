# 📚 Booklaxy — Interactive Book Summarizer (MVP)

> A mobile-first web app where readers can explore or create spoiler-free, character-driven manga and book summaries through interactive graphs.

## 🌟 Vision

Booklaxy starts with **spoiler-free summaries** and **interactive character graphs** for books and manga — and that’s exactly what the current MVP delivers and focuses on.

In the long term, the vision is to build a playful, structured platform that helps users **understand**, **retain**, and **explore** complex narratives — not just across books, but also in **series**, **documentaries**, or even **structured topics** like **scientific research**.

The underlying structure could later support entities beyond characters — such as **items**, **concepts**, or **factions** — to visualize more abstract connections across story worlds or knowledge domains.

These future directions are intentionally left open, while the current focus remains clear and actionable.

## 📌 Project Context

The current MVP focuses on helping readers follow a story visually — without spoilers — and explore character relationships as they read.

It is being tested with early content from **One Piece** (manga), using a mobile-first UX to support on-the-go reading.  
The goal is to onboard initial users, gather feedback, and lay the foundation for future features like community creation tools and revenue sharing.

While users can already add books to their shelf (similar to apps like Bookmory or StoryGraph) and start building summaries, the creation interface is intentionally leaner for now. Priority is placed on delivering a smooth experience for readers first — while early creators help validate the core flow.
